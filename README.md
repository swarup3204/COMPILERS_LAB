# COMPILERS_LAB

**A1**:  
Used github copilot along with extension x86_64 assembly code syntax highlighting on vscode for assignment 1

**A2**:  
Needed to refer to some articles to fully understand asm utility in C, rest of the part was easy as it was done in spl lab, fail and pass test very from person to person

**A3**:  
Needed to make flex rules carefully,especially be careful in identifying comments,string literals and escape sequence.Make a robust test file for testing as it carries marks.Make sure no mistakes as this lexer will be used further in constructing tinyC compiler.
